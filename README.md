CSP2013

This is the first lab exercise of CSP2013, and the source code is contributed by Jeffrey Liu, with the help of Titanxxh.

It's a demo of inode-manager, which allows u to CREATE\GETATTR\GET\POST\REMOVE files.

We've implemented the inferfaces of allocating inodes, reading files, writing files, removing files, allocating blocks,
freeing blocks, freeing inodes.

There's still something you can do to improve this just-so-so codes, we'll appreciate it~

Thanks for watching.
